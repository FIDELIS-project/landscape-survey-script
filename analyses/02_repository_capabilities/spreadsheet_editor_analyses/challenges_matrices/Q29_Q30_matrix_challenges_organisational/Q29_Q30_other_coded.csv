This situation challenges the mission of the VinaR repository, because it makes most of the researchers confused of which infrastructure should be used. On the one hand, VinaR repository is stable, standardised and interoperable with all significant research platforms and services, including the national CRIS system eNauka. On the other hand is the institutional database which is made as an ad hoc system only for internal institutional use without any integration and connection with other services.
