We are actively collaborating with the [Neurobagel project](https://neurobagel.org/) to improve interoperability in our field. This requires more interaction with the depositors to ensure their data is enriched with the necessary metadata from all stages of the experiment.

143,"Deposit & Appraisal: We want to be better integrated with tools researchers use during research to make it easier to deposit data; There are many ways in which the deposit can be made easier for depositors (e.g. creating more automated suggestions, better guidance, easier to include external information already available).

Curation, Quality & Compliance: Metadata quality can be improved, we cannot always judgde the quality of the (meta)data for very specific domains. It would be great to more actively evaluate the reusability of the data but we cannot perform that task due to the workload; Limitations in the funding and available curators is an issue that limits the curation we can perform. Also having a better integration with other research objects (papers, code) would be helpful to enhance reusability and provide integrated information about a dataset to our users.

Discovery & Identification: Users sometimes have difficulty to find and assess what kind of data is available in our repository, improving search and discovery would be great. Some of the metadata we have available is not always exported into all formats limiting the information that is available in aggregators. It is also not always clear how aggregators (especially google) harvest and present our metadata and why certain information is findable or not findable. 

Access: Our biggest challenge is that restricted access datasets for which depositors need to give permission before the data can be downloaded respond slowly or are not available anymore after a given period of time. We are trying to mitigate this, reminding people more often and requiring data access protocols, but it has been proven to be difficult to guarantee long term access to restricted access data. 

Interoperability: Mainly the interoperability of data can be improved. We do perform transformation of data into preferred formats but the data itself is not altered and therefore often not interoperable in terms of the variable descriptions or data structures. It may be beyond our scope but improving interoperability at the data level would be very useful to improve reusability.

Preservation: for all new file formats that emerge preservation needs to be discussed so this is an ongoing aspect I believe. Another challenge that becomes more urgent is the question what data to archive/preserve as the amount of data is growing. How do we decide what data to archive and for how long?

Provenance/authenticity: with our switch to Dataverse we now have better versioning of our data which we did not have in our previous system. Still more information about provenance of the data could be included. 

User support: Despite having extensive guidance on our site, we see users misinterpreting fields or not providing all relevant information which costs time to communicate with them. We have a ticket system for questions but it costs a lot of resources to respond and be available for user questions.

Also having a better integration with other research objects (papers, code) would be helpful to enhance reusability and provide integrated information about a dataset to our users.

Discovery & Identification: Users sometimes have difficulty to find and assess what kind of data is available in our repository, improving search and discovery would be great. Some of the metadata we have available is not always exported into all formats limiting the information that is available in aggregators. It is also not always clear how aggregators (especially google) harvest and present our metadata and why certain information is findable or not findable. 

Access: Our biggest challenge is that restricted access datasets for which depositors need to give permission before the data can be downloaded respond slowly or are not available anymore after a given period of time. We are trying to mitigate this, reminding people more often and requiring data access protocols, but it has been proven to be difficult to guarantee long term access to restricted access data. 

Interoperability: Mainly the interoperability of data can be improved. We do perform transformation of data into preferred formats but the data itself is not altered and therefore often not interoperable in terms of the variable descriptions or data structures. It may be beyond our scope but improving interoperability at the data level would be very useful to improve reusability.

Preservation: for all new file formats that emerge preservation needs to be discussed so this is an ongoing aspect I believe. Another challenge that becomes more urgent is the question what data to archive/preserve as the amount of data is growing. How do we decide what data to archive and for how long?

Provenance/authenticity: with our switch to Dataverse we now have better versioning of our data which we did not have in our previous system. Still more information about provenance of the data could be included. 

User support: Despite having extensive guidance on our site, we see users misinterpreting fields or not providing all relevant information which costs time to communicate with them. We have a ticket system for questions but it costs a lot of resources to respond and be available for user questions.

143,"Deposit & Appraisal: We want to be better integrated with tools researchers use during research to make it easier to deposit data; There are many ways in which the deposit can be made easier for depositors (e.g. creating more automated suggestions, better guidance, easier to include external information already available).

Curation, Quality & Compliance: Metadata quality can be improved, we cannot always judgde the quality of the (meta)data for very specific domains. It would be great to more actively evaluate the reusability of the data but we cannot perform that task due to the workload; Limitations in the funding and available curators is an issue that limits the curation we can perform.
